# Question 4

 ![计算机生成了可选文字: The principal reason ionic compounds are stable is the
 attraction between ions Of opposite charge. This attraction draws the
 ions together ， releasing energy and causing the ions to form a solid
 array ， or lattice ， such as that shown in Figure 8 ． 3 ． A measure of
 how much stabilization results 什 om arranging oppositely charged ions
 in an ionic solid is given by the lattice energy ， which is the “ “ 罗

 ． TO envision this process for NaCl, imagine that the structure in
 Figure 8 ． 3 expands from within ， SO that the distances between the
 ions increase until the ions are very far apart. This process requires
 788 kJ/moI, which is the value of the lattice energy: NaC1(s) -- - 一 十

# Question 39

  -  The **normal melting point** of a solid is defined as the
     temperature at which the solid and liquid are in equilibrium at a
     total pressure of 1 atmosphere.

# Question 43

# Question 54

 ![Keq Only a temperature change can affect the value of Keq. Changes
 in concentrations, pressure or surface area have NO effect on Keq.
 These changes correspond to increase in number of reacting molecules
 per liter. — Increased once and then equilibrium is re-established. So
 ratios of products to reactants do not change. ](./media/image20.png)
