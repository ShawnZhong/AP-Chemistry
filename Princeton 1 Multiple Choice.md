# Question 3

![The shielding effect describes the attraction between an electron and
the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron shell. Shielding
effect can be defined as a reduction in the effective nuclear charge on
the electron cloud, due to a difference in the attraction forces of the
electrons on the nucleus. Shielding effect - Wikipedia

# Question 9

  -  In an **electrochemical reaction**, as the reaction progress, the
     **voltage** of the cell will **decrease** because with a lower
     concentration, the number of electrons that are being transferred
     will decrease

# Question 12

  -  **SF4** has an **asymmetrical** molecular structure

  -  At the **half-equivalence point**, the last part of the
     Henderson-Hasselbalch equation cancels out, leaving **pH=pKa**

# Question 21

 ![The weaker the O-H bond is in an oxoacid, the stronger the acid will
 be as the 1--1+ ions are rmre likely to dissociate. The O-F bond in
 HOF is stronger than the O-CI bond in HOCI because fluorine is
 srnaller (and thus more electronegative) than chlorine. If the O-F
 bond is stronger, the O-H bond is correspondingly weaker, rmking HOF
 the stronger acid. ](./media/image274.png)

# Question 23

  -  **Buffer = a week acid/base + its salt**

# Question 27

  -  With the same amount of limiting reactant, adding more excessive
     reactant will not change the value for H, but the change in
     temperature will decrease for the increase in overall mass

# Question 38 

  -  At **low temperatures** or **high pressures**, real gases
     **deviate** significantly from ideal gas behavior.

# Question 49

  -  The **overall** rate law is always equal to the **rate law** for
     the **slowest** elementary step, which can be determined using the
     **coefficients** of the **reactants**. In this case, rate =
     k\[NO2\]\[F2\]. To get the overall order, we **add** the
     **exponents** in the rate law. 1+1 = 2

# Question 53

  -  Lower vapor pressure = weaker IMFs

  -  IMFs:
    
      -  polar > nonpolar
    
      -  with hydrogen bonding > without hydrogen bonding

# Question 55

  -  If both nonpolar, **more electron** = **more polarizable** =
     stronger IMFs = higher boiling point

# Question 60

  -  **Substitutional** alloys have **similar**, **reduced
     malleability** and **ductility** to interstitial alloys and have
     densities that typically lay between the densities of the
     component metals
