# Question 10

  -  Highest ionization energy: He

 ![The first ionization energy varies in a predictable way across the
 periodic table. The ionization energy decreases from top to bottom in
 groups, and increases from left to right across a period. Thus, helium
 has the largest first ionization energy, while francium has one of the
 lowest. Ionization Energy sciaüifictutor.org https://www.angelo.ed

# Question 15

  -  Lewis acid-base reaction and coordination complex

 ![Metal-Ligand Bond This bond is formed between a Lewis acid and a
 Lewis base. The ligands (Lewis bases) have nonbonding electrons. The
 metal (Lewis acid) has empty orbitals. Che stry of Coordination

 ![The Lewis Acid-Base Concept:Coordination Compounds. In a Lewis
 acid-base neutralization, the base donates a pair of electrons forming
 a coordinate covalent bond which joins the two species together into
 the reaction product. The Lewis Acid Base Concept: Coordination

 ![Carbon- 14 6 protons 8 neutrons Carbon- 1 0 6 protons Beta-minus
 Decay Nitrogen- 14 Antineutrino Electron 7 protons 7 neutrons
 Beta-plus Decay Boron- 1 0 5 protons Neutrino Positron

 into solution. Il. Water molecules move methanol molecules apart as
 the methanol oes into so n rmo ecu ar attractions form between
