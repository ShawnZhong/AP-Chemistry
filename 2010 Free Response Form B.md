# Question 1 (a)

 ![normal butane isobutane unbranched butane Common name IUPAC name
 Molecular diagram Skeletal diagram n-butane butane i-butane
 2-methylpropane H H H—C—C H H —C ](./media/image110.png)

# Question 1 (b)

 ![(b) On the basis of molecular structure, identify the isomer that
 has the higher boiling point. Justify your answer. The isomer n-butane
 has the higher boiling point. London (dispersion) forces are greater
 among molecules of n-butane than they are among molecules of isobutane
 because molecules of n-butane, with its linear structure can approach
 one another and can form a greater number of induced temporary dipoles
 than molecules of isobutane, with its more compact structure, can
 form. One point is earned for the correct choice of isomer with
 justification. ](./media/image111.png)

# Question 2 (d)

  -  Log is 10-based in Chemistry

 ![(d) Calculate the value of the equilibrium constant K for the cell
 reaction at 250C. Explain what the magnitude of K tells you about the
 extent of the reaction. log K eq — 0.0592 K = 6.5 x 1060 5 x 0.72 = 61
 0.0592 Because the magnitude of K eq is very large, the extent of the
 cell reaction is also very large and the reaction goes essentially to
 completion. One point is earned for the correct substitution. One
 point is earned for the correct numerical answer. One point is earned
 for an explanation. ](./media/image112.png)

# Question 3 (d)

 ![ore /ör/ O a naturally occurring solid material from which a metal
 or valuable mineral can be profitably extracted. Translations, word
 origin, and more definitions ](./media/image113.png)

# Question 5 (e)

 ![(e) What is the difference between the equivalence point of a
 titration and the end point of a titration? The equivalence point in a
 titration occurs when the number of moles of titrant added is exactly
 sufficient to react completely with the number of moles of the
 titrated One point is earned for each correct species present in the
 sample being titrated. definition. The end point of a titration is the
 point in a titration at which the indicator undergoes its color
 change. ](./media/image114.png)

# Question 6 (g)

 ![(g) Is the oxygen atom, O, a catalyst for the reaction or is it an
 intermediate? Explain. The O atom is an intermediate because it is
 formed and then consumed during the course of the reaction. (Had it
 been a catalyst, it would have been present both at the be innin and
 the end of the reaction.) One point is earned for the correct choice
 with explanation. ](./media/image116.png)

 (Cl): consumed in an earlier step, released (regenerated) in a later
