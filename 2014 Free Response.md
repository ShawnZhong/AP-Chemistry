# Question 6 (b)

 ![CH3 Propene Vinyl Chloride (chloroethene) (b) The boiling point of
 liquid propene (226 K) is lower than the boiling point of liquid vinyl
 chloride (260 K). Account for this difference in terms of the types
 and strengths of intermolecular forces present in each liquid. Both
 substances have dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion
 forces (or propene is essentially nonpolar with only LDFs while vinyl
 chloride has both LDFs and dipole-dipole forces). Propene contains a
 CH3 group, but vinyl chloride contains a Cl atom. Vinyl chloride thus
 has a larger electron cloud, is more polarizable, and has a larger
 dipole moment. Thus intermolecular attractions are stronger in vinyl
 chloride, which results in it having the higher boiling point. 1 point
 is earned for a discussion of intermolecular forces and for a
 comparison of their relative strengths. ](./media/image205.png)

 ![Half-Life The half-life ofa reaction, h n, is the time required for
 the concentration ofa reac- tant to reach half its initial value, \[A
 h 2 — Half-life is a convenient way to de- scribe how fast a reaction
 occurs, especially if it is a first-order process. A fast reaction has
 a short half-life. We can determine the half-life of a first-order
 reaction by substituting A = —kt1/2 ITC —kt1/2 Time A Figure 14.10

 disappearance of reactant A with time. for CA\] tand t1/2 for t in
 Equation 14.12: In — t1/2 = \[14.15\] k 0.693 k From Equation 14.15,
 we see that t1/2 for a first-order rate law does not depend on the
 initial concentration of any reactant. Consequently, the half-life
 remains constant throughout the reaction. If, for example, the
 concentration of a reactant is 0.120 M at some instant in the reac-
 tion, it will be M) = 0.060 M after one half-life. After one more
 half-life passes, the concentration will drop to 0.030 M, and so on.
 Equa- tion 14.15 also indicates that, for a first-order reaction, we
 can calculate t1/2 if we know k and calculate k if we know t1/2. The
 change in concentration over time for the first-order rearrange- ment
 of gaseous methyl isonitrile at 199 oc is graphed in Figure 14.11.
 Because the concentration of this gas is directly proportional to its
 pres- sure during the reaction, we have chosen to plot pressure rather
 than concentration in this graph. The first half-life occurs at 13,600
 s (3.78 h). At a time 13,600 s later, the methyl isonitrile pressure
 (and therefore, 150 75 h/2 37.5 10,000 20,000 Time (s) 30,000
 concentration) has decreased to half of one-half, or one-fourth, of
 the initial value. In a first-order reaction, the concentration of the
 reactant decreases by one-half in each of a series of regularly spaced
 time intervals, each interval equal to ti/2. A Figure 14.11 Kinetic

 ![The half-life for second-order and other reactions depends on
 reactant concentra- tions and therefore changes as the reaction
 progresses. We obtained Equation 14.15 for the half-life for a
 first-order reaction by substituting \[A h 2 = for \[A)tand ti/2 for t
 in Equation 14.12. We find the half-life of a second-oråer reaction by
 making the same substitutions into Equation 14.14: \[Alo — \[A\] 0 1 1
 — kt1/2 + 2 C A 10 1 = kt1/2 1 \[14.17\] In this case, the half-life
 depends on the initial concentration of reactant—the lower the initial
 concentration, the longer the half-life. ](./media/image212.png)

# Question 7 (c)

 ![(c) Is the initial rate of the reaction in trial 1 greater than,
 less than, or equal to the initial rate in trial 2 ? Justify your
 answer. The initial rate in trial 1 is less than that in trial 2
 because rate k \[cis-2-butene\] or rate kP cis-2-butene (with
 reference to values from both frials). OR because the initial
 concentration of cis-2-butene in trial 1 is less than that in trial 2
 and k is constant. 1 point is earned for the correct answer with
 justification. ](./media/image213.png)

# Question 7 (d)

 ![(d) The half-life of the reaction in trial 4 is less than the
 half-life in trial 1. Explain why, in terms of activation energy. The
 temperature is higher in trial 4, meaning that the KEavg of the
 molecules is greater. Consequently, in this trial a greater fraction
 of collisions have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy
 barrier, thus the rate is greater. 1 point is earned for a correct
 answer with justification. ](./media/image214.png)
