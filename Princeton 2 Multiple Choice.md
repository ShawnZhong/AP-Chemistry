# Question 11

  -  The **further away** an electron is from the nucleus, the **less
     binding energy** that the incoming photons need to overcome, and
     as a result, the **more** **kinetic energy** the electron will
     have after it is ejected.

# Question 20

 (MJ/mol) • The shell model does not separate the 8 electrons in n = 2.
 But The PES for boron does not support that. • PES data tells us that
 the model must be revised, as the n = 2 shell must contain 2 subshells
 with different IE. • Each peak corresponds to a subshell or sublevel.

# Question 21

 The **bond length** always corresponds to the point where the
 **potential bond** **energy** (a balance of the attraction and
 repulsion forces between the two atoms) is at it’s **minimum** value.

# Question 23

  -  **Weak acids resist changes in pH** more effectively than strong
     atoms because so many molecules of weak acid are **undissociated**
     in solution. The base must cause those molecules to dissociate
     before affecting the pH significantly.

# Question 25

  -  When calculating enthalpy, the **total energy** is always the
     **bonds broken** (reactants) **minus** the **bonds formed**
     (products). The more positive this value is, the more energy there
     is in the reactants compared to the products.

# Question 36

  -  The outermost **s-block** electrons in a **transition metal** tend
     to be **lost** before the d-block electrons
 do.
