# Question 3

  -  There is no molecular in ionic compound, neither does
     INTRAMOLECULAR force.

# Question 8

  -  Hydrolysis and Brønsted–Lowry acid–base reaction

 ![Hydrolysis of Ions There are many ionic salt's that make the aqueous
 solution acidic or basic. The reaction of ionic salts with water is
 called 'Hydrolysis of salts" Hydrolysis can be explained using
 Brönsted Lowry theory. If the conjugate acid or base is strong then
 there will be hydrolysis. Weak acids and bases produce strong
 conjugate bases and acids ](./media/image142.png)

# Question 10

  -  Root-mean-square speed

 ![Uses of RMS Velocity RMS speed is used to predict how fast molecules
 are moving at a given Temperature. 3kT 3RT How fast molecules move is
 directly proportional to their absolute temperature and inversely
 proportional to their mass. R k Because • • k = F— then— R

# Question 17

 ![STRUCTURE & PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS Summary: Ionic Electrically
 conductive if molten Brittle Usually crystalline High melting point
 (solids at SATP) Metals Electrically and heat conductive Malleable and
 ductile Lustrous and ha rd Medium to high melting points (solid at
 SATP) Molecular No n-conductive Amorphous Non crystalline usually Low
 melting point (liquid or gas) Covalent Network Sometimes conductive
 (C) Rigid to flexible Patterned spatial bonds Medium to high melting
 points ](./media/image145.png)

  -  Covalent network solid

  -  Molecular solid

 ![Molecular solids are solids that are essentially collections of
 molecules held together by intermolecular forces (IMFs). The solid
 structure is maintained by IMFs rather than bonds (metallic, covalent,
 or ionic). The forces holding the solids together are much weaker than
 for other types of solids. Molecular solids - Chemistry 301

 below is the best procedure? (A) Rinse the buret one time with some of
 the titrant solution. (B) Rinse the buret one time with some of the
 titrant solution and then dry the buret in an oven. (C) Rinse the
 buret two times: once with some of the titrant solution, then once
 with distilled water. (D) Rinse the buret two times: each time with
 some of the titrant solution. nse e uret two times: eac time WI
