# Question 1 (a)

  -  Write the state of each substance for dissolving equation

 ![The Solubility Expression AaBb(s) aAb+ (aq) + bBa- (aq) Ksp =
 \[Ab+\]a \[Ba-\]b Example:Pb12 (s) Pb2+ + 21- Ksp = \[Pb2+1 \[I-r
 \*The greater the ksp the more soluble the solid is in 1-120.

# Question 1 (b)

 ![(ii) Calculate the minimum concentration of F-(aq) necessary to
 initiate precipitation of the salt selected in part (b)(i). 3.5 = =
 3.5 x 10-10 = \[F-\]2 -10 = 10-5M 3.5 x 10 1 point is earned for the
 correct value of \[F - \]. ](./media/image173.png)

# Question 3 (c)

 ![(c) Calculate the magnitude of q, the thermal energy change, when
 the MgO was added to the 1.0 M HCl(aq). Include units with your
 answer. - mcAT q calorimeter In trial 2, OR In trial 3, OR In trial 4,
 q cal = q cal = q cal = (4.18 Jh 1.0 g) 100.0 mL x + 0.50 g mL ) (
 4.18 Jh 1.0 g) 100.0 mL x + 0.25 g mL ) ( 4.18 J h 1.0 g h ) (4.00

 point is earned for the correct mass of the solution. 1 point is
 earned for the correct calculation of q for any frial with a valid AT
 and ) = 1700 Jor 1.7kJ correct units.

# Question 4 (a)

 ![:ä-p-ä: Phosphate Ion ](./media/image176.png)

  -  Write ionic equation if possible

# Question 5 (a)

 ![(a) Describe TWO reasons why the pressure changes as the temperature
 of the C2H4(g) increases. Your descriptions must be in terms of what
 occurs at the molecular level. Two reasons are: (1) As the temperature
 increases, the of the molecules increases and the molecules collide
 with the container walls. (2) As the temperature increases, the of the
 molecules increases and the molecules strike the walls of the
 container with 1 point is earned for each correct reason.

# Question 6 (c)

 ![CH2C12 is polar, whereas CC14 is not. Therefore, CH2C12 interacts
 with H20 via dipole-dipole forces, while CC14 only interacts with
 water via dipole/induced dipole forces or LDFs, which would be weaker.
 As a result, CH2C12 has a greater solubility. ](./media/image179.png)
