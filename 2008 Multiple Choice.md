# Question 10

 ![The entroPY of exactly equal to zero. At absolute zero (zero
 kelvin), the system must be in a state with the minimum possible
 energy, and the above statement of the third law holds true provided
 that the perfect crystal has only one minimum energy state. Third law

 ![Lattice energy is defined as the energy required to separate a mole
 of an ionic solid into gaseous ions. Lattice energy cannot be measured
 empirically, but it can be calculated using electrostatics or
 estimated using the Born-Haber cycle. Lattice Energy - Boundless

# Question 11

  -  Quantity typically determined by measuring the rate of a reaction
     at two or more different temperatures: Activation Energy

  -  The activation energy can also be found algebraically by
     substituting two rate constants (k1, k2) and the two corresponding
     reaction temperatures (T1, T2) into the Arrhenius
 Equation

# Question 49

  -  Most Phosphates are insoluble

 ![Many phosphates are not soluble in water at standard temperature and
 pressure. The sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and ammonium
 phosphates are all water-soluble. Most other phosphates are only
 slightly soluble or are insoluble in water. Phosphate - Wikipedia

# Question 54

 ![In chemistry, an ideal solution or ideal mixture is a solution with
 thermodynamic properties analogous to those of a mixture of ideal
 gases. The vapor pressure of the solution obeys Raoult's law, and the
 activity coefficient of each component (which measures deviation from
 ideality) is equal to one. Ideal solution - Wikipedia

  -  Raoult's law

 ![Raoult's Law • The common mathematical statement for this behavior
 is known as Raoult's Law: P s\&vent s\&vent • Poin is the observed
 vapor pressure of the solution • is the mole fraction is the vapor
 pressure of the pure solvent. ](./media/image57.png)
