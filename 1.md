# Question 1 (c)

> ![Using Ka to Calculate pH Knowing the value of Ka and the initial
> concentration of a weak acid, we can calculate the concentration of
> H+(aq) in a solution of the acid. Lees calculate the pH at 25 oc of a
> 0.30 M solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH), the weak acid responsible
> for the charac- teristic odor and acidity of vinegar. 1. Our first
> step is to write the ionization equilibrium: CH3COOH(aq) H+(aq) +
> CH3COO (aq) \[16.28\] Notice that the hydrogen that ionizes is the one
> attached to an oxygen atom. 2. The second step is to write the
> equilibrium-constant expression and the value for the equilibrium
> constant. Taking Ka = 1.8 X 10 5 from Table 16.2, we write 5 = 1.8 x
> 10 \[CH3COOH\] \[16.29\] 3. The third step is to express the
> concentrations involved in the equilibrium reac- tion. This can be
> done with a little accounting, as described in Sample Exercise 16.10.
> Because we want to find the equilibrium value for l, let's call this
> quan- tity x. The concentration of acetic acid before any of it
> ionizes is 0.30 M. The chem- ical equation tells us that for each

> assume that x is ne li ible relative to 0.30 so that 0.30 — x is
