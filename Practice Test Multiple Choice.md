# Question 23

 ![A solvation shell is the solvent interface of any chemical compound
 or biomolecule that constitutes the solute. When the solvent is water
 it is often referred to as a hydration shell or hydration sphere. A
 classic example is when water molecules arrange around a metal ion.

  -  For the process of solid calcium chloride **dissolving in water**,
     the **entropy** change is **negative** since **water molecules**
     in the hydration shells of Ca2+ and Cl- ions are **more ordered**
     than they are in the pure water

 ![Polarity and Boiling Point: The polarity of the molecules determines
 the forces of attraction between the molecules in the liquid state.
 Polar molecules are attracted by the opposite charge effect (the
