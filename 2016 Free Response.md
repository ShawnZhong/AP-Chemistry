# Question 1 (d)

 ![(d) Which salt, LiCl or NaCl, has the greater lattice enthalpy?
 Justify your answer. LiCl. Because the Li ion is smaller than the Na
 ion, ions in LiCl are stronger than in NaCl. This results in a greater
 lattice enthalpy. 1 point is earned for the correct choice and
 justification. ](./media/image240.png)

# Question 1 (f)

 ![(f) The lattice enthalpy of LiCl is positive, indicating that it
 takes energy to break the ions apart. in LiCl. However, the
 dissolution of LiCl in water is an exothermic process. Identify all
 particle-particle interactions that contribute significantly to the
 exothermic dissolution process being exothermic. For each interaction,
 include the particles that interact and the specific type of
 intermolecular force between those particles. There are interactions
 between Li+ ions and polar water molecules and between Cl- ions and
 polar water molecules. These ar ion-dipole interactions. 1 point is
 earned for identifying the particles that interact. 1 point is earned
 for correctly identifying the type of interaction.

# Question 2 (e)

 ![The HCOg- ion has three carbon-to-oxygen bonds. Two of the
 carbon-to-oxygen bonds have the same length and the third
 carbon-to-oxygen bond is longer than the other two. The hydrogen atom
 is bonded to one of the oxygen atoms. In the box below, draw a Lewis
 electron-dot diagram (or diagrams) for the HC03- ion that is (are)
 consistent with the given information. ](./media/image244.png)

# Question 2 (f)

 ![(f) A student prepares a solution containing equimolar amounts of
 HC2H302 and NaC2H302. The pH of the solution is measured to be 4.7.
 The student adds two drops of 3.0 M HN03(aq) and stirs the sample,
 observing that the pH remains at 4.7. Write a balanced, net-ionic
 equation for the reaction between HN03(aq) and the chemical species in
 the sample that is responsible for the pH remaining at 4.7. C2H302- +
 H30+ HC2H302 + H20 OR C2H302- + H+ HC2H302 I point is earned for a
 correct equation. ](./media/image245.png)

# Question 3 (d)

 ![(d) Explain why 12 is a solid at room temperature whereas Br2 is a
 liquid. Your explanation should clearly reference the types and
 relative strengths of the intermolecular forces present in each
 substance. Both Br2 and 12 molecules are nonpolar molecules, therefore
 the only possible intermolecular forces are London dispersion forces.
 The London dispersion forces are stronger in 12 because it is larger
 in size with electron cloud. The stronger London dispersion forces in
 12 result in a higher melting point,which makes 12 a solid at room
 temperature. 1 point is earned for identifying the forces in each
 substance as London dispersion forces. 1 point is earned for
 explaining why the forces are stronger in 12 than in Br2 .

# Question 6 (a)

 ![(a) Considering the value of K for the reaction, determine the
 concentration of Ba(EDTA)2-(aq) in the 100.0 mL of solution. Justify
 your answer. Based on the K value, the reaction goes essentially to
 Ba2+(aq) is the limiting reactant. The concentration of Ba2+ when the
 solutions are first mixed but before any reaction takes place is 0.20
 M/2 = 0.10 M. Thus the equilibrium concentration of Ba(EDTA)2-(aq) is
 0.10M. 1 point is earned for indicating that the equilibrium
 concentration of Ba(EDTA)2-(aq) is the same as the original
 concentration of Ba2+ when the solutions are mixed. 1 point is earned
 for the concentration with appropriate calculations.
